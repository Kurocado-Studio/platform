**Turn engineering foundations into installable developer products.**

A modular, DX-first system built in TypeScript that transforms the repetitive scaffolding of
frontend development—CI/CD, QA, IAM, and developer utilities—into reusable, open-source modules.

## Why This Platform

Developers shouldn’t spend days setting up pipelines, authentication, or testing harnesses. With the
Kurocado Studio Platform, you can:

- Set up CI/CD and QA in minutes.
- Add authentication flows with drop-in modules.
- Keep repos aligned with zero-drift configurations.
- Scale from startups to enterprise with built-in security.

This isn’t boilerplate—it’s a **Platform-as-a-Product**.

## What’s Included

Install only what you need:

- [**QA Module**](QA.md) — Vitest + React Testing Library with accessibility-first defaults.
- [**IAM Module**](IAM.md) — Auth0, RBAC, reusable guards and providers.
- [**DevOps Workflows**](CI-CD-Workflows.md) — GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and automated
  releases.
- [**DX Utilities**](DevExp.md) — Axios wrappers, error handlers, form helpers, and more.

## Built on Top of the Style Guide

The **[Kurocado Studio Engineering Style Guide](https://github.com/Kurocado-Studio/styleguide)** is
not a platform module but the foundation that underpins all projects. It establishes:

- TypeScript best practices
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Commit conventions
- Zero-drift code hygiene

By separating the Style Guide into its own project, any repository—inside or outside the
platform—can adopt the same standards consistently.

This ensures that every module built on top of the platform inherits a unified, professional
baseline.

## Key Benefits

- Faster onboarding — new projects spin up in under 5 minutes.
- Zero-drift standards — shared configs and CI keep repos consistent.
- Composable — pick and install only what you need.
- Open-source ready — all modules are published on NPM.

## Strategic Value

This platform is both a technical foundation and a business differentiator:

- Transparency — open-source modules make coding standards visible.
- Efficiency — milestone + 20% buffer model supported by reusable scaffolding.
- Differentiation — freemium approach.
- Scalability — supports startups, enterprises, and government-level security needs.
