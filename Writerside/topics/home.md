# Kurocado Studio Platform

A unified foundation for building frontend products with **consistency and velocity**.

The Kurocado Studio Platform is a minimal but powerful TypeScript-first foundation designed for
teams and solo developers who want to build multiple apps without constantly reinventing tooling,
architecture, or baseline standards. It provides a shared core you can build on, keeping everything
aligned across projects while letting each product stay independent.

---

## **Why This Platform Exists**

Most frontend work breaks down because every app becomes its own isolated universe. Tooling drifts,
patterns diverge, and teams waste time repeating the same setup work over and over.

This platform removes that friction by centralizing the core engineering foundation — the parts that
should never be re-implemented — so every new app starts from a stable, opinionated baseline instead
of zero.

---

## **What the Platform Includes**

### **Core Framework**

A shared TypeScript foundation containing:

- common configuration presets
- reusable utilities and abstractions
- consistent architecture guidelines
- patterns for React/Vue projects
- build scripts and shared workflows

This is the layer every product can rely on.

---

### **Platform CLI (coming soon)**

A command-line tool for generating new apps with the platform’s standards baked in.

It will provide:

- ready-to-use templates
- consistent project structures
- automatic wiring of shared configurations
- rapid setup for internal tools or demos

---

## **How It Fits Together**

The platform acts as the root foundation. From it, you create individual products or internal tools
that inherit shared rules, configuration, and engineering patterns.

This ensures:

- every new app starts aligned
- changes to the foundation propagate cleanly
- no duplicate setup or configuration work
- future scaling doesn’t introduce drift

---

## **Who It’s For**

- Developers building multiple apps who want a consistent baseline
- Small teams that need speed without sacrificing structure
- Anyone creating internal tools, demos, prototypes, or production apps
- Engineers who want to avoid repetitive setup work and focus on product delivery

---

## **Why It Matters**

Keeping a platform like this forces discipline: a single source of truth for engineering decisions,
predictable foundations across all repos, and zero wasted energy on boilerplate. It removes the
tedious parts of starting and maintaining projects and supports long-term growth without chaos.
