# DevEX

Kurocado Studio’s **Developer Experience (DevEx)** repository centralizes utilities and workflows to
enhance productivity for both internal and client-facing projects. Core components include:

- **Axios Wrappers** for simplified API interactions
- **Reusable React Hooks** for handling common application tasks
- **Streamlined Form-Handling Libraries** to reduce boilerplate

By consolidating these tools, we ensure rapid, consistent development practices across our
organization.

## Objectives

1. **Frictionless Development Workflows**

   - Provide easy-to-use libraries that reduce boilerplate and manual setup, allowing developers to
     focus on features rather than configuration.

2. **Consistent & Maintainable Code**

   - Standardize how APIs are called, forms are handled, and state is managed, ensuring all teams
     produce quality, uniform code.

3. **Reusability & Extensibility**

   - Encourage the sharing of common solutions—like React hooks—across different projects, while
     still allowing customization for unique needs.

4. **Accelerated Project Onboarding**
   - Minimize ramp-up time for new developers or external contributors by offering straightforward,
     documented utilities they can plug into any Kurocado Studio project.

## Use Cases

1. **Internal Team Adoption**

   - Kurocado Studio’s internal teams will rely on this Dev Experience solution as the definitive
     reference for utility libraries—ensuring new features can be developed quickly and uniformly.

2. **External Contributor Alignment**

   - External developers or freelancers working with Kurocado Studio can incorporate the same
     libraries and patterns, avoiding inconsistent approaches or duplicate effort.

3. **Client Collaboration**
   - The Dev Experience solutions (e.g., axios wrappers, form libraries, and custom hooks) will
     serve as transparent, cost-free resources for clients and other boutique studios. By making
     these libraries openly available, we empower external teams to do business with the studio.

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope

- **Common Utility Libraries**
  - Preconfigured axios instances, shared config for request/response interceptors, and error
    handling patterns.
- **Reusable React Hooks**
  - Hooks for data fetching, form handling, and state management that streamline typical workflows.
- **Documentation & Examples**
  - Clear usage guides, code snippets, and best-practice patterns for front-end (and possibly
    back-end) tasks.

### Constraints

- **Evolving Ecosystem**
  - Third-party dependencies (React, axios, form libraries) update frequently, requiring consistent
    maintenance and versioning.
- **Resource Allocation**
  - Limited developer time mandates focusing on the highest-impact utilities first.
- **Client-Specific Needs**
  - Striking a balance between universal solutions and specialized client requests may require
    flexible plugin or extension systems.

## Key Milestones

1. **Foundational Utilities**

   - Publish core axios wrapper, basic React hooks (e.g., useFetch), and initial form-handling
     utilities.
   - Provide fundamental documentation and example usage in a sample application.

2. **Expansion & Refinement**

   - Extend libraries to handle more complex use cases (e.g., file uploads, concurrency control, or
     advanced validation).
   - Optimize developer ergonomics by improving TypeScript definitions, error boundaries, or dev
     tooling integration.

3. **Client Forking & Customization**

   - Document how clients can fork and adapt these utilities or create their own versions.
   - Provide guidelines for merging upstream changes to maintain a shared baseline while respecting
     client-specific logic.

## Success Criteria

1. **Developer Efficiency**

   - **Reduced Boilerplate**: Projects using these libraries should require fewer lines of
     repetitive code (e.g., form handling or API calls).
   - **Ease of Adoption**: Teams can integrate and deploy these utilities within minutes, cutting
     down on project setup time.

2. **Consistency & Quality**

   - **Shared Patterns**: All new Kurocado Studio projects incorporate standardized API call
     patterns and form handling, minimizing code fragmentation.
   - **Improved Code Reviews**: By unifying approaches (e.g., error handling), reviewers focus on
     logic instead of style or architecture differences.

3. **Client Collaboration**

   - **Successful Forking**: Clients adopt or customize our Dev Experience without significant
     engineering overhead.
   - **Unified Upstream**: Clients can easily pull in new updates from the main repository, ensuring
     ongoing alignment with the latest best practices.
