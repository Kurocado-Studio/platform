# Business Plan

<note>Condensed for brevity</note>

## The Problem

Many startups and mid‑market companies in Chicago struggle with traditional web‑development shops
that bill by the hour, usually ending up with scope creep and missed deadlines.

## The Solution

Kurocado Studio offers a Creative‑SaaS engagement model that eliminates these pain points. Every
project begins with a paid Discovery phase that produces a general‑contractor pricing model: the
amount quoted in the estimate is the amount you pay—no hidden fees, no surprises.

| **Pillar**                         | **How It Works**                                                           | **Client Benefit**                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agile Discovery + PRD/RFC Gate** | Paid discovery produces a fixed‑scope PRD or RFC before any coding begins. | Up‑front budget certainty and a kill‑switch if priorities change. |
| **20 % Contingency Buffer**        | Contingency is baked into every estimate rather than added later.          | No surprise invoices and maintained delivery velocity.            |
| **Open‑Source Freemium Assets**    | Public design system, style guide, and Auth SDK are shared freely.         | Immediate value, full transparency, and faster onboarding.        |

## Business & Revenue Model

After the Discovery phase, we issue a line‑item, fixed‑bid proposal that includes both labor and
material costs, plus a built‑in contingency for the unknowns. Payments are released in milestone
draws tied to clearly defined acceptance criteria, so clients never pre‑pay for unfinished work and
we never exceed the agreed total.

If priorities shift, a formal change‑order protocol produces a mini‑estimate that must be approved
before any new scope begins. Post‑launch, clients can opt into flat‑rate care plans that cover
maintenance and support under a defined service‑level agreement, replacing unpredictable retainers
with predictable operating expense.
